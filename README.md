# java-works

#NOTE: main class in CompareSorters class
#NOTE: when key == 1, type in a number as the size of the points.
#NOTE: when key == 2, the program reads a list of points in a file, there is a sample file called "points.txt"


#program works fine, maybe unknown bugs exsiting 
#issue of creating visual image of the points 
#the drawing part deleted for now 
#the creation of the files could be improved
